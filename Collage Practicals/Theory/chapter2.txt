(1.) constructor : rules , types , constructor overloading with example

    -  In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.
    -  Constructors are special methods that are used to initialize objects.
    -  It is called whenever an instance of that class is created.
    -  Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
    -  constructors do not have any return type
    -  A class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.


  => Rules :-

    1.  The name of the constructors must be the same as the class name.
    2.  Java constructors do not have a return type. not even 'void'
    3.  There can be multiple constructors in the same class.
    4.  Constructors can have parameters to initialize the object with specific values
    5.  The access modifiers can be used with the constructors
    6.  Java provides a default constructor that is invoked during the time of object creation. If you create any type of constructor, the default constructor provided by Java will not invoked.

  => Types :-

      There are three different types of constructors in Java, we have listed them as follows:

        1. Default Constructor :-

             -A constructor with no parameters is called Default Constructor.
             -It initializes the object's members to default values provided in Constructor.

             ex:- 
                public class Box {
                    double length;
                    double width;
                    double height;
                
                    // Default Constructor
                    public Box() {
                        length = 1;
                        width = 1;
                        height = 1;
                    }
                }


        2. Parameterized Constructor :-

             -A constructor with parameters is called Parameterized Constructor
             -It allows initialization of the object with specified values provided in Constructor.
             
             ex:-
                public class Box {
                    double length;
                    double width;
                    double height;
                
                    // Parameterized Constructor
                    public Box(double length, double width, double height) {
                        this.length = length;
                        this.width = width;
                        this.height = height;
                    }
                }

        3.  Copy Constructor :-

            - A constructor that initializes an object by copying the data of another object of the same class is called Copy Constructor.
            
            ex:-
                public class Student {
                    private String name;
                    private int age;

                    // Copy constructor
                    public Student(Student other) {
                        this.name = other.name; 
                        this.age = other.age;   
                    }
                }

            Student student1 = new Student("Alice", 20);
            Student student2 = new Student(student1);



(2.) Constructor overloading

    - Constructor overloading is a concept in OOP where a class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
    - This allows the class to be instantiated in different ways
    - It provides flexibility in object creation and initialization.

    =>ex :-
      public class Rectangle {
            private double length;
            private double width;
         //Constructor 1
            public Rectangle() {
                length = 1.0;
                width = 1.0;
            }
         //Constructor 2
            public Rectangle(double side) {
                length = side;
                width = side;
            }
         //Constructor 3
            public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
                this.length = length;
                this.width = width;
            }
      }


(3.) Explain all Visibility or Access modifiers with example 

    - The access modifiers in Java are used to control the accessibility of the variables, data members, methods, classes, or constructors.
    - There are four main access modifiers in Java:

    1. public :-

        - Public elements are accessible from anywhere within the same package or from any other package.  //packages are the programms of a same file.
        - They are visible to all other classes and packages.
        - There are no scenarios where public elements become inaccessible, as they are always accessible.

        =>ex: 
            //MyClass.java
            public class MyClass {
                public int publicVar = 10;
            
                public void publicMethod() {
                    System.out.println("This is a public method.");
                }
            }


            //AnotherClass.java
            public class AnotherClass {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    MyClass obj = new MyClass();
                    System.out.println(obj.publicVar);   // Accessing public variable
                    obj.publicMethod();                   // Accessing public method
                }
            }

    2. default :-

        - Default elements are accessible only within the same package.
        - They are not accessible from outside the package.
        

        => ex ; 

            //MyClass.java
                class MyClass {
                    void defaultMethod() {
                        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
                    }
                }

            //AnotherClass.java
                public class AnotherClass {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
                        obj.defaultMethod(); // This is a default method.
                    }
                }


    3. Protected:-

        - Variables, methods, and constructors, which are declared protected in a superclass can be accessed only by the subclasses in the current package or other package.
        - They are not accessible by unrelated classes outside the package, except through inheritance.

        => ex :-

            //MyClass.java
                public class MyClass {
                    protected void protectedMethod() {
                        System.out.println("This is a protected method.");
                    }
                }

            //AnotherClass.java
                public class AnotherClass {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
                        obj.protectedMethod(); // This is a protected method.
                    }
                }
                //error !, AnotherClass is not a subclass of MyClass, so it cannot access the protectedMethod() directly from within its main() method


    4. private :-

        - Private elements are accessible only within the same class.
        - They are not accessible from outside the class, even by subclasses.

        =>ex :-
            //MyClass.java
                public class MyClass {
                    private void privateMethod() {
                        System.out.println("This is a private method.");
                    }
                }

            //AnotherClass.java
                public class AnotherClass {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
                        // obj.privateMethod(); // Compilation error: privateMethod() has private access in MyClass
                    }
                }



(4.) string vs StringBuffer with ex               
    
                string                                           StringBuffer 

    1. The String class is immutable.  1.The StringBuffer class is mutable.
    2. As for Performance, It is slow  2.As for Performance, It is fast
    3. it can’t be modified            3.its object can be modified 
    4. Methods are not synchronized    4.All methods are synchronized in this class. 
       in this class. 
    5. it uses String constant pool    5.it uses Heap memory
    6. it consumes more memory         6.it consumes less memory
    7. ex:-                            7. ex:- 
        String str = "Hello";               StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer();
        str += " World";                    result.append("Hello");
        System.out.println(str);            result.append(" World");
                                            System.out.println(result);



(5.) explain method overloading & method overriding 

    => Method Overloading :

        - Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
        - Method overloading is a compile-time polymorphism.
        - In method overloading, methods must have the same name and different parameters.
        - In method overloading, the return type can or can not be the same, but parameters must be different.
        - Static binding is being used for overloaded methods.
        - Poor Performance due to compile time polymorphism.
        - Private and final methods can be overloaded.
        
        - ex:-
          
          public class Calculator {
                // Method to add two integers
                public int add(int a, int b) {
                    return a + b;
                }
                
                // Method to add three integers
                public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
                    return a + b + c;
                }
                
                // Method to add two doubles
                public double add(double a, double b) {
                    return a + b;
                }
            }
        

    =>Method Overriding :-

        - Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its specific implementation of a method that's already provided by its parent class or superclass.
        - Method overriding is a run-time polymorphism.
        - Method overriding always needs inheritance.
        - In method overriding, methods must have the same name and same parameters.
        - Dynamic binding is being used for overriding methods
        - It gives better performance
        - Private and final methods can’t be overridden.
        - The argument list should be the same in method overriding.
        - ex :- 
            class Animal {
                public void makeSound() {
                    System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
                }
            }
            
            class Dog extends Animal {
                // Overrides the makeSound method in the superclass
                public void makeSound() {
                    System.out.println("Dog barks");
                }
            }



(6.) pass by value vs pass by reference in java

    => Pass By Value:
        
        - In pass by value, a copy of the actual value of an argument is passed to the parameter of the method.
        - Any changes made to the parameter inside the method do not affect the original value of the argument. 
        - Java is Strictly Pass by Value
        -ex :-
            
            public class PassByValueExample {
                void modifyValue(int x) {
                    x = x + 1;
                }
            
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    PassByValueExample example = new PassByValueExample();
                    int num = 5;
                    example.modifyValue(num);
                    System.out.println(num); // Output: 5 (num remains unchanged)
                }
            }

    => Pass By reference :-

        - In pass by reference, a reference of the actual object is passed to the parameter of the method , not the actual object itself.
        - This means that changes made to the object's state inside the method will affect the original object outside the method.
        - while Java is Strictly Pass by Value , the behavior with objects resembles "pass by reference" because you are passing a copy of the reference to the object, allowing you to modify the object's state within the method. 
        - ex :- 
            class Person {
                String name;
                
                Person(String name) {
                    this.name = name;
                }
            }
            
            void changeName(Person p) {
                p.name = "John"; // Change the name field of the Person object
            }
            
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Person person = new Person("Alice");
                changeName(person);
                System.out.println(person.name); // Output: John (name field of the original object is changed)
            }


(7.) explain final , static , super and this with ex
    
    1. final keyword :-
        
        - The final keyword in Java is used to declare constants variables, methods, and classes. 
        - Once assigned, a final variable's value cannot be changed
        - A final method is a method that cannot be overridden or modified by subclasses. 
        - A final class in Java is a class that cannot be subclassed or extended by other classes.
        - ex:
            public class FinalExample {

                final int CONSTANT_VALUE = 10; // Final variable
            
                final void display() { // Final method
                    System.out.println("This is a final method.");
                }
            
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    FinalExample example = new FinalExample();
                    System.out.println(example.CONSTANT_VALUE); // Output: 10
                    example.display(); // Output: This is a final method.
                }
            }
            
    
    2. static :-

        - In order to share the same method or variable of any given class, the static keyword is used. 
        - static variable and methods can be accessed without creating an object of the class.
        - Static variables can be reinitialized.
        - static variables and methods belong to the class rather than object
        - Static methods can only access the static members of the class and can only be called by other static methods.
        - The object of Static class can’t be created and it only contains static members only.
        -ex:
            public class StaticExample {
                    static int count = 0; // Static variable
                
                    static void incrementCount() { // Static method
                        count++;
                    }
                
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        StaticExample.incrementCount(); // Accessing static method
                        System.out.println(StaticExample.count); // Accessing static variable
                    }
                }
        - Static block is used to initialize the static variables in a class.
        - ex: 
            public class StaticVariableExample {

                static int count;
            
                static {
                    count = 10;
                    System.out.println("Static block initialized count to: " + count);
                    //the sout will be printed first on loading of a programm
                }
            
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    System.out.println("Value of count: " + count);
                }
            }


    3. super :-

        - The super keyword in Java is used to access members of the superclass (parent class).
        - It is used to call the constructor, methods, and variables of the superclass.
        - ex :-
            class Animal {
                String sound = "Animal Sound";
            }
            
            class Dog extends Animal {
                String sound = "Bark";
            
                void displaySound() {
                    System.out.println(super.sound); // Accessing superclass variable
                }
            }
            
            public class SuperExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    Dog dog = new Dog();
                    dog.displaySound(); // Output: Animal Sound
                }
            }
 

    4. this :-

        - The this keyword in Java is used to refer to the current object.
        - It is primarily used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name
        - ex :-
            class Person {
                String name;
            
                Person(String name) {
                    this.name = name; 
                }
            
                void display() {
                    System.out.println("Name: " + this.name); 
                }
            }
            
            public class ThisExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
